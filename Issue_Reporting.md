Reporting Issues
================
So, you found an issue in my code? or do you have an idea for the mod? you should read this article before continuing, so that your issue is not marked as invalid and closed.

## Starting
First off, it is suggested that you do these steps all at once, after you read this entire article.


If you are stuck on finding the issue tracker, click on the circled ! on the repository's main page.
The first thing you should do when you get there is look for other issues that address the same thing (the search bar is a great help).
If that is the case, write a comment on it saying something along the lines of
> can confirm {insert relevant information here}

If not, click ont the big green `new issue` button

## How to write a good title
For my repositories, the issue reports generally look like `[version#] brief description of issue`. an example of it done correctly could be `[1.2.97rc2] Player Rotation`.

## Writing the body
The body should be brief, but fully explain the issue.
If a crash log is given, a link to a [pastebin](http://www.pastebin.com), or a [gist](http://gist. Github.com) should be included somewhere in the report.
Pictures are always appreciated and can be dropped in the bar at the bottom, or pasting them.
The main body is parsed in markdown, so make it look good.
Some of the guides i have used are from [markdown here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and [Github guides](https://guides. Github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

##Feature Requests
A feature request is basicaly you (the person with the idea) telling us (the developers) that you want __this__ feature in the mod, but don't know how / don't want to add it yourself.
The only diiffrence between this and an issue report lies in the title.
The begining should proudly frature a [Feature Request] thing, folowed by what you want added.
The discription body should contain what exactly this feature should do.
